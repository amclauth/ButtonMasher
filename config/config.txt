This config file should be built with a list of characters to press, followed by 
three colons, then the number of seconds (decimals work) of delay between key
presses. For example, if the first character is a "d" and the numbers following
the three colons are 12.87, it means "d" will be pressed every 12.87 seconds.

Note that there is also a random delay built into the button presses. Currently
this is set for up to three seconds. This is to make it look slightly less mechanical.
So in reality, the above example would be pushed every 14.37 seconds on average ...
the minimum gap between presses will be 12.87 seconds and the maximum gap will be
15.87 seconds.
