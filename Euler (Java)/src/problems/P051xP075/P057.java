/**
 * P057<br>
 * It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.
 * 
 * âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
 * 
 * By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
 * 
 * 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
 * 
 * The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example
 * where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
 * 
 * In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
 * Ans:153

    * first is 1/1, then 3/2, then 7/5, etc. From 1/1 we add 1/2, so we multiply 1 * 2 and add 1, then put it over 2. 
    * Next, we have 1 + 1/(2+1/2), so the denominator becomes that (2*2+1)/2 which gets flipped into 2/5, and adding 1 to it, 
    * we get 7/5. So the denominator ends up being this series of 1,2,5,12,29, etc. The differences are 1,3,7,17, etc. The
    * differences are the sum of the last two numbers! So if we know 1 and 2, the next is 2+(1+2)=5. The next is 5+(5+2)=12. 
    * The next is 12+(12+5)=29. So we have a solid series for the denominator. 
    * The numerator is the difference we already found, 3,7,17, etc. So the numerator is just the sum of the current denominator
    * and the previous one.
    * That means that the difference is the numerator of the previous ratio!
    * So if we have an existing n/d, the next d is just n+d. The new numerator is the sum of the previous two denominators.
    * That's the new denominator plus the last denominator. Just (n + d) + d, or n + 2d.
