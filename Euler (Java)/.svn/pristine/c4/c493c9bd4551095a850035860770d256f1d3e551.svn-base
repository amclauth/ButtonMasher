/**
 * P058<br>
 * Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is 
that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If 
this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals 
first falls below 10%?
